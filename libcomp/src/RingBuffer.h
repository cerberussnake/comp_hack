/**
* @brief Single producer, single consumer, lock free, no wait ring buffer.
*
* The capacity of the ring buffer may be adjusted to a multiple of the system
* page size that is also a power of two. The reported/effective capacity of
* the ring buffer will be 1 less than the true capacity of the internal
* buffer. The capacity of the ring buffer will never be less than the
* requested capacity.
*
* Read and writes should be performed on the provided buffer without any
* wrap-around logic. This is handled internally with memory mapping.
*
* This ring buffer is thread safe if the following requirements are met:
* - A maximum of two threads access the ring buffer.
* - If two threads are used, one thread performs write operations (producer)
*   and the other thread performs read operations (consumer).
* - A thread must never change roles (producer/consumer).
* - @ref BeginRead must always be followed by @ref EndRead. No other calls to
*   the ring buffer should be made by the same thread in-between these calls.
* - @ref BeginWrite must always be followed by @ref EndWrite. No other calls to
*   the ring buffer should be made by the same thread in-between these calls.
* - The consumer should never read more bytes from the given buffer than
*   returned by @ref BeginRead.
* - The call to @ref EndRead should pass the size updated by @ref BeginRead.
* - The producer should never write more bytes into the given buffer than
*   returned by @ref BeginWrite.
* - The call to @ref EndWrite should pass the size updated by @ref BeginWrite.
* - Neither thread should use the ring buffer until the constructor has
*   returned and all threads should stop using the ring buffer before the
*   destructor is called. The ring buffer may be constructed and destructed
*   by any thread as long as this condition is met.
