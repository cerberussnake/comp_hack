/**
 * Convenience class to read and write packet data. This class is designed to
 * make it easy to read and write packet data. Strings can be converted between
 * the internal Unicode format and Windows code pages. All integer numbers can
 * be written in host byte order, big endian, or little endian. The packet data
 * is usually read or written in sequantial order but you can use random access
 * as well. Note that data is not inserted into the middle of the packet, it
 * is instead overwritten with the new data. Here is some example code:
 * @code
 * Packet p;
 * p.WriteU16Little(0x1234); // Code for this packet.
 * p.WriteBlank(4); // Number of items (blank for now).
 *
 * // Initialize the item count to 0.
 * int count = 0;
 *
 * // Loop through and write each item to the packet.
 * while(HaveItems())
 * {
 *     count++;
 *     p.WriteU32Little(NextItem());
 * }
 *
 * // Return to where the item count should be, write the count, and return
 * // the current position back to the end of the packet.
 * p.Seek(2);
 * p.WriteU32Little(count);
 * p.End();
 * @endcode
